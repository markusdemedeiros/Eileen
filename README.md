This project is an implementation for some of the data structures of [Iris](https://iris-project.org) in Lean.
While the ultimate goal of the project is to back [lean-iris](https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean) with a fully-fledged Iris implementation, the immediate goal is to mechanize enough of the foundations to instansiate the frontend with ``upred``.
